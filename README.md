# basic-operations-in-c

This is a basic example of control flow in c.
The statements inside source files generally are executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear. Control flow statements break up the flow of execution by employing decision making. In other words, the C programming language gives general decision-making capability in the form of an if statement (in addition to loops--for, while, do--and branches--break, continue, and return).
